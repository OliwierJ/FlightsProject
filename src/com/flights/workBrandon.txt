updateDatabase() on booking should automatically check is it a new or existing booking, update all passengers and all seats via their methods

TODO: update Aircraft to generate seats and layouts, boeing 777 has complex layout, each layout should most likely be a method inside of its own aircraft class
TODO: update updateDatabase() method with these changes


HOW IT WORKS:

VIEW BOOKING:
call Booking b = new Booking(bookingID)
this will automatically fetch ALL relevant booking details from the database

UPDATE BOOKING:
requires view booking to be run first, objects can be extracted from Booking b
updateDatabase() can then be called after changing any values in Passenger or Seat of Passenger
only ever call updateDatabase() on Booking b

CANCEL BOOKING:
requires view booking to be run first
method deleteBooking() can be called on Booking b which deletes entries in the database related to Booking b


NEW BOOKING:
Flight f will be used, return Flight rf optional
Seat objects will be generated for each Flight, occupied seats will be gathered from database

new booking can be created using Booking b = new Booking() or = new Booking(email, priority, luggage, Flight departure, Flight arrival (can be null))
if empty constructor used, details can be added through the setters (preferred option)

passenger objects will be created through GUI, passenger details in GUI
seats will be assigned to passengers by calling passenger.addSeat(Seat s), seat being the seat selected in GUI

Passengers can then be added to Booking b by using addPassengers(Passenger... passengers);
updateDatabase() on Booking b will be called to create the booking in the database
confirmation message then
